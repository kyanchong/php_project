                <h2>What to know about our society</h2>
                <p>First of all, welcome. Said the name proposed, our society club is all about dancing. Let's talk about the society environment. The society is full of fun activites which you will not be bore, as well as cool and funny people.<br>
                You, newcomers may think that dancing was just about some fancy moves along with moving your body more vigorously and a few expressions here and there, but no. When you learn from an experienced professional they not only tell you how to move your body but also how to enjoy dance as an art and dance to the rhythm. This is the vibe that our club give out.                  
                </p>
                <p>Dance provides numerous functions in a society. Historically, dance was often performed in rituals, worship, social celebrations, and as a means of entertainment and self- expression. Today, dance is still a part of traditional events but also as an element of new innovative performing experiences.                       
                </p>
                <p>You learn new moves and learn to do them as accurately as possible. You learn about dance from various places on various different types of music. You also learn about group dynamics and interactions with other people.
                </p>
                <p>    
                Apart from this, there are numerous health benefits and it keeps the body fit. But this does not mean that you necessarily need to join a dance class, I felt that a dance class can just enhance the overall dance experience, but if you are comfortable on your own then you can definitely do it on your own.

                <h2>Dance Society's Rules</h2>
                <p>1. When dancing, you should pay attention to the amount of space youâ€™re taking up and how your presence affects other people<br>
                    2. Wear proper shoes and attire to protect the floor, yourself, and other dancers<br>
                    3. No food or drinks are allowed on the dance floor<br>
                    4. faucibus pulvinar elementum integer. Sed felis eget velit aliquet sagittis id.
